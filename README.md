All users can register with the system and create an account. A user must log in to the system
before using it. A user can be a host and may set up their own events. A user can also be a
participant and book tickets to other peopleâ€™s events.
2. A user may create an event, setting suitable conditions and features of the event including the
description, location, date, categorisation, number of tickets available and end date.
3. A user can search the system for categories of events and can browse events within certain
categories or timeframes.
4. A user can book a ticket for an event. The system will manage the ticket sales until the set end
time. No further ticket sales will be permitted if the event is full or if the end time for ticket sales
of that event has been reached.
5 Participants can view a list of events they are attending and receive emailed updates on events
that are imminent. You only have to show that an event (creating an email message) can be
triggered at the date and time, you do not need to implement an email system.
6. Users hosting events can view the progress of ticket sales and generate a list of participants for
an event.
7. Participants can give feedback and ratings on events after they have happened. Ratings and
feedback are visible to other users.
